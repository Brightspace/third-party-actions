# Approved third-party GitHub Actions for D2L

All third-party authored GitHub Actions at D2L have to be approved.
We mirror the repos into independent branches of [Brightspace/third-party-actions](https://github.com/brightspace/third-party-actions).
Here's what's available so far:

* [geertvdc/setup-hub](https://github.com/Brightspace/third-party-actions/tree/geertvdc/setup-hub): configures the hub CLI for GitHub automations
* [jakejarvis/hugo-build-action](https://github.com/Brightspace/third-party-actions/tree/jakejarvis/hugo-build-action): Hugo is a static site generator
* [omsmith/actions-tasklists](https://github.com/Brightspace/third-party-actions/tree/omsmith/actions-tasklists): creates build statuses for tasks in PRs

The configuration lives in [Brightspace/third-party-actions-config](https://github.com/Brightspace/third-party-actions-config) so that we can disable (other peoples) actions in the main repo.
