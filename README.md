# Upload Code Coverage

Upload a Cobertura XML coverage report to GitHub's code coverage API.

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-code-coverage@v1
  with:
    file: cobertura.xml
    language: Java
    label: code-coverage/jacoco
```

The action handles everything else automatically: gzip/base64 encoding, resolving the correct commit SHA and ref, detecting PR number (from both `pull_request` and `push` events), and calling the upload API.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | Yes | | Path to the Cobertura XML coverage report |
| `language` | Yes | | Linguist language name (e.g. `Java`, `Go`, `Python`) |
| `label` | Yes | | Label for the report (e.g. `code-coverage/jacoco`) |
| `fail-on-error` | No | `true` | Whether to fail the workflow step if the upload fails |
| `token` | No | `github.token` | GitHub token with `code-quality:write` permission |

## Permissions

The calling workflow or job must grant `code-quality: write`. The action cannot declare this itself.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  code-quality: write
```

For push-only workflows where the action looks up PR numbers via `gh pr list`, also add `pull-requests: read`.

## Error handling

By default, the action fails the workflow step (exits with code 1) when the upload is unsuccessful. This ensures you notice when coverage data is not being stored.

If coverage upload is best-effort in your workflow and you don't want a transient API failure to block CI, set `fail-on-error: false`:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-code-coverage@v1
  with:
    file: cobertura.xml
    language: Java
    label: code-coverage/jacoco
    fail-on-error: false
```

When `fail-on-error` is `false`, upload errors are still surfaced as `::error::` annotations in the workflow log, but the step exits 0.

## Event handling

The action auto-detects the event type and resolves the correct values:

- **`pull_request` / `pull_request_target`**: Uses the PR head SHA and ref (not the merge commit), and includes the PR number.
- **`push`**: Uses `github.sha` and `github.ref`, and looks up whether the branch has an open PR via `gh pr list`.

This means it works with both patterns — workflows triggered by `pull_request` and push-only workflows that serve PRs via branch pushes.

## Full example (separate upload job)

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}

      # ... build and generate cobertura.xml ...

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository
        with:
          name: cobertura-report
          path: cobertura.xml

  upload-coverage:
    needs: build
    if: ${{ !cancelled() && needs.build.result == 'success' && (github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository) }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      code-quality: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cobertura-report

      - uses: actions/upload-code-coverage@v1
        with:
          file: cobertura.xml
          language: Java
          label: code-coverage/jacoco
```

## Caveats

- **Fork PRs are not supported.** Pull requests from forks don't have write access to the base repository, so the action cannot upload coverage. When a fork PR is detected, the action exits gracefully with a notice — it won't fail your CI.
- **Merge queue runs are skipped.** Coverage should be uploaded for PRs and the default branch, making merge queue uploads unnecessary. The action logs a warning and exits successfully.
